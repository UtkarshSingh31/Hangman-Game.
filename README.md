# Hangman-Game.
Hangman is a popular word-guessing game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for many years. The basic premise of the game is simple: one player, known as the "executioner," thinks of a word, while the other player(s) try to guess the word by suggesting letters.

Features:

Random Word Selection: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
Letter Guessing: Players enter a letter to guess.
Win/Lose Conditions: The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or the stick figure is complete.
Error Handling: The game handles invalid inputs and provides appropriate feedback.
User Interface: A simple and intuitive command-line interface.

Run the hangman.py file.
The game will display a series of underscores representing the hidden word.
Enter a letter as your guess.
If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed.
If the letter is not in the word, a part of the stick figure will be drawn.
Continue guessing until you either guess the word correctly or the stick figure is complete.
